# Biography

I am currently a Postdoc at GFDL under the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling project (SOCCOM). My general interests centre around constraining uncertainty of future climate projections. I'm working on the role of the Southern Ocean ice sheet melt and wind changes in current and future climates. Recently, I studied air-sea carbon fluxes in the Southern Ocean, ocean carbon inventories, Ocean Revelle Buffer factor changes in oxygen minimum zones, ocean heat redistribution and ocean anthropogenic carbon uptake in observations and climate models.
